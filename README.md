Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems are designed to be solvable using a computer program, and many of them involve optimizing algorithms for efficiency. You can learn more and access the Project Euler problems at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
This repository contains my solutions to various Project Euler challenges implemented in Java. Project Euler is a collection of challenging computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. I have made a discipline to solve a problem everyday since 5th December 2023 and have a vision of completing all the problems there is. 

## Structure
The repository is organized by problem names, and each problem has its own directory. Within each problem directory, you'll find:
- Question from the Project Euler Website
- The Java source code for solving the problem.
